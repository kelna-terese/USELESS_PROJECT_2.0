## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Nomu]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Kelna] - [AISAT]
- Member 2: [Jeeva] - [AISAT]

### Project Description
[PazhamPori Counter is a fun, food-themed click counter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to learn and practice basic web development skills while making something light-hearted and culturally familiar.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[‚ÄúHow do we track the number of PazhamPoris we've eaten without eating them?‚Äù

This project solves the totally unnecessary but deeply satisfying need to count imaginary PazhamPoris just by clicking a button. No real calories involved ‚Äî just pure digital joy."

]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[A shiny button that goes click and adds one more PazhamPori to your imaginary plate üçåüî•
With stylish fonts and sweet colors, it‚Äôs the only tool you‚Äôll ever need to feel productive without doing anything useful.
Built using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî because who needs frameworks when you're counting fritters?]
